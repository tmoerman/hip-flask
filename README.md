# Hip-flask

A study project for learning Flask and its extensions.
Inspired by: 

## Setup

1. First initialize a virtual environment relative to the project folder (`hip-flask`).    
    
    ```
    > python3 -m venv venv        
    ```
    
    This create a `venv` folder, where we will install the project's dependencies.        

2. Activate this environment in a bash-like shell.

    ```
    > source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the Python dependencies.

    ```
    (venv) > pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. To use this venv in Pycharm, see `Settings > Project: hip-flask > Project interpreter`.
